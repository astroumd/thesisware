\section{Facilities and Software in a Thesis}

\subsection{Introduction}

\label{random}

We are proposing to add a special section {\bf Facilities and
  Software} to a thesis. Like is the case in some current journals,
this would be placed before the {\bf References}. Journals are
increasingly asking for, sometimes even insisting on, this
information, and funders also want to see how facilities, projects,
and data they have paid for are used and contribute to the discipline
(Vishniac and Lintott, 2016\footnote{\tt
  https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/0004-6256/151/2/21}).
Summarizing this information well would be very helpful for all
stakeholders in the thesis. We maintain the example on
github\footnote{\tt https://github.com/astroumd/thesisware} in case
you want to look for updates or issues.


Below is a template to show how ApJ's \verb+\facilities{}+ and
\verb+\software{}+ could be used in a thesis. Here we show examples in
5 different categories that the student can show of what was used to
complete the thesis. Optionally they can refer (with a URL or page
number) where this was introduced in the thesis.

Before we formally recommend this procedure, we will need to make sure
we such a Section does not violate the Grad School requirements,
otherwise one can also treat it like an Appendix.
